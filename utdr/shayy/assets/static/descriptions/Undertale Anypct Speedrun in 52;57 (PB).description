Unfortunately fell just short of WR (this would've been WR if it happened 5 hours before it did), but I finally broke the 52 barrier. Dogi Skip kept what was originally a pretty dead run in good pace and the rest of the game was executed well. New Home in particular was a 4:09 segment which is the best I have ever performed in any category. This is a really satisfying run to finally get. :)
