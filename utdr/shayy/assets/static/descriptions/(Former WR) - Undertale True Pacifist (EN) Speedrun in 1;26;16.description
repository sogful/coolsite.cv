Finally got the time I was looking for, feels good to go full circle and get WR in the category I started the game with over a year ago.


As of 10/8/18 the Undertale speedrun leaderboards will be split between versions 1.00/1.001 and 1.02+ because of a large routing change due to badly programmed inputs in the newer versions. This is played on Linux 1.001, and is the world record for this version of the game on the boards, just barely beating out TGH's previous WR of 1:26:21. The 1:24 time by SnowieY101 is on version 1.05 and is on a different board as a result. At the time of this recording, the leaderboards haven't actually been split yet but it is currently in the process of happening.
