Pain.

This is the first time I've uploaded any glitchless run to YouTube so I figure I would quickly run down what that entails:
Neutral Glitchless speedruns do the Alphys Neutral ending by playing No Mercy all the way up until Muffet, then spare Muffet and then get a Neutral ending. We are not allowed to obtain the Punch Card or do any major glitches, which makes this the fastest way to get a Neutral ending without those.
