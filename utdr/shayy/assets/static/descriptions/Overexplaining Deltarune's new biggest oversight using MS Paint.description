Deltarune recieved two patches, 1.08 and 1.09, back to back, and both had very broken oversights regarding Save Points. This is a clip from my stream of me explaining why it happens and the very negative consequences it has for casual players, as well as the uses in the speedrun.

Please show respect to the developers, I am sure this has been very stressful for them especially with what is happening in the world right now. Obviously I hope it gets fixed, which is why I uploaded this here.
