Happy Birthday!
Celeste turns 2 years old today, and I figured I would do something to celebrate.

This was a strange arrangement. At first I was going to do a more one-to-one translation of the original piece, but I found myself enjoying just playing over the chords so much that it transformed into a much longer cover.
When it actually came time to record, I original set aside much more time but was actually happy with how this one-take recording sounded so I just went with it. In tradition I also came up with an intro, for which I used Celeste's main theme.
