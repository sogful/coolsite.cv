Undertale turns 5 years old today. If you follow this channel at all you know how much this game means to me and what a huge impact it has had on my life.


I've always wanted to cover this piece, and I wanted to make absolutely sure I felt it was given the respect it deserved. This is one of my favorite pieces from the OST as a whole and I wanted to capture what makes it so impactful.
