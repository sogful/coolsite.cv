Toby Fox once said he regretted not adding a run button to Undertale. How about we fix that?

In this video, I play a mod of Undertale that turns me into Kris from Deltarune. This allows me to run at super quick speeds and have some pretty funny interactions with a lot of Undertale's game design. Enjoy!
