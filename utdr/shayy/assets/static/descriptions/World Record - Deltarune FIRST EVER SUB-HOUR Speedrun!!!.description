The first ever sub-hour All Chapters is here!!

I am SO happy with this. I have been playing this category for about a week's worth of streams straight and finally everything went my way. The only majorly improvable segments are getting HHS in CH1 (lol) and the Berdly split in CH2. Other than that, this was a pristine run with a super clutch NEO fight at the end; my CH2 segment was actually technically a PB for CH2 Any%, but it can't be submitted due to equipment differences.
