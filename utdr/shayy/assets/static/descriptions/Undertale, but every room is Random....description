Is it possible to beat Undertale when every room's location is completely randomized?

Today's mod randomizes the entrances of all rooms in the game. My goal is to find the Neutral ending, but I also want to see if I can find the Pacifist ending as well as a certain Mystery Man who's hiding amongst the rooms.
