A new World Record for this category! Wish it had been one second faster though... ^_^;;

For those who don't know, I'm playing CH2 Main Route Glitched in AGDQ 2022! As a result, I've been practicing that route a lot. Unfortunately, it's probably the most do-or-die category in the game and as a result I haven't gotten a run I'm super proud of yet which is why YouTube content has been just a bit dry. To take a break from the glitches killing my runs constantly I did a few runs of Glitchless to see if I could take the WR back with my heightened skills and it seems it was a success!
