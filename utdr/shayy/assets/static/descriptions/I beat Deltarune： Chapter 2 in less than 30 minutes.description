Wait, there's a city in this game?! News to me.

There has been a massive new gamebreaking glitch discovered through the efforts of multiple runners and technical experts, myself included. Using this Doorway Overflow, we are able to reach Queen's Mansion in under 5 minutes and complete the game in a blazing fast amount of time!! I will make a full in-depth video on this glitch very, very soon!!
